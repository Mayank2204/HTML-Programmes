<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cryptology   or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries).<br />More generally, it is about constructing and analysing protocols that block adversaries, various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptology.<br /> Modern cryptology   exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering.<br /> Applications of cryptology   include ATM cards, computer password, and electronic commerce. We can also say that it is science concerned with data communication and storage in secure and usually secret form. <br /><br /> Security obtains from legitimate users being able to transform information by virtue of a secret key or keys—i.e., information known only to them.</p> 
<h3><a name="para1"></a>paragraph1</h3>
 <p>The resulting cipher(numeric character), although generally inscrutable and not forgeable without the secret key, can be decrypted by anyone knowing the key either to recover the hidden information or to authenticate the source.<br /> Cryptology   prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense.<br /> The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same.<br /> Modern cryptology   is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. <br />It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means<br />These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure.<br /> Cryptology was initially only concerned with providing secrecy for written messages, especially in times of war.</p>
<h3><a name="para2"></a>paragraph2</h3>
<p>Its principles apply equally well, however, to securing data flowing between computers or data stored in them, to encrypting facsimile and television signals, to verifying the identity of participants in electronic commerce (e-commerce) and providing legally acceptable records of those transactions.<br /> Cryptology referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called cipher text). <br />Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible cipher text back to plaintext.</p>
<h3><a name="para3"></a>paragraph3</h3>
 <p>A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption. <br /> The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a "key".<br /> This is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, which is needed to decrypt the cipher text.<br />  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes.<br />  In cryptology, code has a more specific meaning.<br /> It means the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, "wallaby" replaces "attack at dawn").</p>
<h3><a name="con"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Cryptology, indeed, has long been a part of modern daily life. In particular, electronic banking and various financial, medical, and legal databases depend on cryptology for security.<br /> One example is the personal identity number (PIN), a coded identification that must be entered into an automated teller machine (ATM) along with a bankcard to corroborate that the card is being used by an authorized bearer. <br />The PIN may be stored in an encrypted form (as a cipher) either in the bank’s computers or on the card itself.<br /> The transformation used in this type of cryptology is called one-way; i.e., it is easy to compute a cipher when given the bank’s key and the customer’s PIN, but it is computationally infeasible to compute the plaintext PIN from the cipher even when the key is known.<br /> This protects the cardholder from being impersonated by someone who has access to the bank’s computer files.</p>
